# Todo Apps

This is my first attempt to learn frontend development.

## Stack

- Vite (this project is created using command `npm create vite@latest`)
- React + Typescript
- Firebase (as backend)

## Tech Debt

- [ ] Testing. Either unit testing / integration testing.
- [ ] Styling. This application is ugly AF without styling :sob:

## Working Live Demo

Live demo can be found [here](https://adliih.github.io/demo-todo/)
